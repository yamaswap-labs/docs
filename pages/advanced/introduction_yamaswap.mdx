## What is an ETFs

An ETFs (Exchange-Traded Fund) is a fund that is listed and traded on a stock exchange, similar to a stock, and can be bought and sold on an exchange. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs are more flexible and can be traded in real time, just like stocks.ETFs typically track an index, sector, or basket of assets, which investors can indirectly hold by purchasing the ETFs. Simply put, an ETFs is a portfolio of assets with multiple asset allocations.

## What is permissionless crypto ETFs?

TrETF indexes are usually created by institutions or brokers, and the ETFs themselves require a manager to make adjustments to the ETFs and charge an annual management fee. Because of smart contracts and AI agents, in the future Web3 world, ETFs can be managed by AI together with smart contracts, and they are hosted on the public chain running on the smart contracts at a very cheap price, users only need to buy their favorite ETFs indexes without having to pay management fees, and the fees are transparent, all the assets that make up the ETFs indexes can be voted on by the holders to add or remove an asset. At the same time, any user can create a new ETFs index through the ocx protocol interface provided by Yamaswap, and can specify which assets are in the ETFs index, which is permissionless ETFs index, and users only need to have a wallet to create and track any cryptocurrency index.

## The future of ETFs

In the future, Yamaswap will launch some official indexes, such as tracking indexes created by grayscale, [coinbase 50](https://www.coinbase.com/coin50), binance, [VirtualBacon Portfolio](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSu2SmQZTDh127cxt6iRX2Uz-JjhrSqW57QsYuhf63ffPcwbPeLcXcZDiCWa_tbVFV-Od5NlCMsZbV4/pubhtml), and create an ETFs through a protocol, so that users can conveniently buy assets directly on Solana, base, and other public chains without having to wait for the traditional ETFs indexes to be compliant in order to make purchases.

Currently, the only ETFs's available are bitcoin and eth, but for users, Yamaswap believes that more users want to own other crypto assets, so we've built a new protocol that allows anyone to create a new index, such as your kol followers, who can also build a new ETFs through the ocx protocol. We have built a new protocol that allows anyone to initiate a new index, such as a kol you follow, and they can also build a new ETFs index using the ocx protocol, which can be used to allow more fans to track and copy trade.

We firmly believe that the future of cryptocurrencies will inevitably be predominantly on-chain, according to the latest data from The Block, in December 2024, the network's mainstream DEX spot trading volume reached a record high of $323.25 billion. This figure represents a 7.89% YoY increase from November's $299.61 billion.

For users, asset security and privacy will be an important trend in the future, such as the recent rise of pump, hyperliquid and other platforms, are based on on-chain transactions, user-owned, user-controlled, no need for permission is the trend of the next 10 years.
