# Yamaswap Integrates TradingView to Enhance Trading Experience

Yamaswap has applied for the integration of TradingView, bringing more intuitive charting and technical analysis tools.

Through this partnership, users can:

## 1. Real-time market analysis

Easily track cryptocurrency price movements and optimize trading strategies using TradingView's professional K-charts and technical indicators. For example, with the [BTC/USD](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/) price trend chart, users can understand the price changes and market dynamics of different cryptocurrencies at a glance, helping to formulate a more strategic trading plan.

## 2. Backtesting Function

Simulates trading decisions from historical data to help users optimize their strategies and improve their return on investment.

## 3. Seamless Experience

In the future, users will be able to use TradingView tools directly in Yamaswap's trade details interface without switching platforms, making operations more efficient and convenient.

If the combination with TradingView can be achieved, Yamaswap will be able to provide users with smarter and more convenient trading support, and also meet the needs of some professional users to carry out K-line assistance.
