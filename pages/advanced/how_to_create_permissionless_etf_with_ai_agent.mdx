# How to Create Permissionless Crypto ETFs with AI Agents

With the development of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and AI (Artificial Intelligence), decentralized ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) are becoming the new investment trend in the Web3 era. With AI Agents, users can automate portfolio management and create Permissionless crypto ETFs without the intervention of traditional fund managers. In this article, we will explore how AI Agents can be used to create, manage and optimize crypto ETFs on decentralized platforms such as YamaSwap.

## 1. What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are artificial intelligence systems with autonomous decision-making capabilities that execute investment strategies based on market data, algorithms and user preferences. In the crypto market, AI Agents are mainly used for:

Market Analysis: real-time tracking of price, volume, social media sentiment and other metrics.

Asset Allocation: adjust portfolios based on historical data and machine learning.

Risk Management: dynamically adjust positions to prevent losses from dramatic market fluctuations.

AI Agents combined with smart contracts can efficiently manage ETF assets without human intervention, enabling decentralized ETFs with higher transparency and lower management costs.

## 2. Why Choose Decentralized ETFs?

Decentralized ETFs offer the following advantages over traditional ETFs:

Permissionless: Anyone can create and manage their own ETF without the need for approval from a third-party organization.

Higher Transparency: all trading and position information is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring openness and transparency.

Automated management: real-time portfolio adjustments through AI Agents to increase return potential.

High Flexibility: supports customized strategies such as DeFi Blue Chip ETF, GameFi Track ETF, KOL Tracking ETF, etc.

For example, on the YamaSwap platform, users can choose indices such as Grayscale, Coinbase 50, IBIT, CMC100, or VirtualBacon Portfolio as a reference, or create their own Permissionless ETFs using AI.

## 3. How to create Permissionless crypto ETFs using AI Agents?

### Step 1: Choose the underlying assets

On YamaSwap or other DeFi ETF platforms, users have the freedom to choose assets, including:

- Mainstream cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.)
- DeFi tokens (AAVE, UNI, DYDX, etc.)
- GameFi tokens (AXS, MANA, SAND, PRIME etc.)
- KOL Recommended Portfolio (Grayscale, Coinbase 50, CMC100)

### Step 2: Set up the AI investment strategy

Different AI Agents apply to different investment strategies, common strategies include:

Passive Index Tracking: automatically track Grayscale, CMC100 and other mainstream indices and maintain long-term holdings.

Trend Following: automatically increase or decrease holdings of specific assets based on market trends analyzed by AI.

Risk Balance: Use AI to calculate Max Drawdown and dynamically adjust asset weightings to reduce the impact of market volatility.

Reinvestment of Earnings: Automatically use the earnings portion of an ETF to buy more assets, increasing the compounding effect.

### Step 3: AI monitoring and rebalancing

The market environment is constantly changing and AI Agents need to perform regular Rebalancing:

When the market rises: the AI automatically adjusts positions to lock in some of the profits.

When the market is falling: AI will detect overshooting assets and cover positions appropriately to optimize long-term returns.

Macro Trend Changes: AI will adjust ETF weights based on indicators such as BTC price, ETH Gas fee, and on-chain trading volume.

On platforms such as YamaSwap, users can set a rebalancing cycle (e.g., monthly, quarterly) or let the AI adjust automatically based on market dynamics.

## 4. AI-driven crypto ETF case study

Case 1: Decentralized AI ETF  
 Investment Strategy:

- 50% BTC (long-term stability)
- 30% ETH (growth potential)
- 20% AI-related tokens (FET, OCEAN, AGIX)

AI Logic:

- If BTC/ETH volatility is too high, adjust to stablecoin USDC
- AI monitors FET price breaching the 20% threshold and automatically locks in profits

Case Study 2: KOL Tracking ETF

Investment Strategy:

- Refer to VirtualBacon, Grayscale positions, dynamically assign weights
- 70% Mainstream assets (BTC, ETH, SOL)
- 30% KOL recommended DeFi/GameFi tokens

AI Logic:

- Monitor KOL position changes and automatically adjust ETF structure
- Combine with social media sentiment analysis to optimize buy/sell timing

## 5. Future Prospect: Infinite Possibilities of AI + DeFi

The combination of AI and DeFi is reshaping the crypto investment ecosystem, and possible future trends include:

AI Agent DAOs: Asset investment and management using AI-created DAOs.

Permissionless ETFs: each user can have their own proprietary ETF that automatically adjusts based on individual risk appetite

Cross-chain ETF interoperability: AI will manage multi-chain assets (Solana, Base, Ethereum, etc.) to provide richer portfolios

YamaSwap is driving this change by making it easy for everyone to create, manage and optimize Permissionless crypto ETFs, making AI-driven DeFi investing a reality.

## Conclusions

AI Agents are revolutionizing the way DeFi investing is done, providing users with a smarter, decentralized, automated crypto ETF solution. With AI tracking the market in real-time, optimizing investment strategies, and dynamically adjusting positions, decentralized ETFs are becoming the new asset management tool of the Web3 era.
