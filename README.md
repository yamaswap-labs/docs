## What is yamaswap

Yamaswap is a high-performance decentralized trading protocol based on the Solana blockchain that combines Automated Market Maker (AMM) and cryptocurrency ETFs functionality to provide users with fast trading, flexible liquidity management, and new index investing options. Yamaswap is not only a decentralized exchange, but an innovative on-chain investing tool that seamlessly combines traditional ETFs with DeFi, allowing users to experience asset appreciation and diversification.

At Yamaswap, our goal is to create permissionless decentralized fund platform that gives users the experience of a centralized index fund platform. Every decision we make at Yamaswap is aimed at providing a better user experience, where users can choose to trade on different supply channels, supporting leading Dex platforms such as Ray, Okx, Cow, Uni and more.

Leveraging Solana's technology, Yamaswap provides a trading environment that not only rivals the experience of traditional ETFs, but also surpasses them in terms of security and transparency. "Yamaswap, created by the community, has attractive permissionless crypto ETFs like SPX".
